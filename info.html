      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Production</h3>
      <p>The process starts with collecting materials. We receive used PET bottles from households and recycling centers, while fabric scraps come from the textile industry or old clothing. Next, the materials are thoroughly cleaned: plastic bottles are washed, stripped of labels, and shredded into small pieces. Fabric scraps are sorted, cleaned, and in some cases, decolored.
After that, the transformation begins. The shredded plastic is melted down and spun into fine polyester fibers.
Similarly, the fabric scraps are broken down into fibers - either mechanically or chemically. These newly created fibers from plastic and fabric are then blended and spun into yarn.
This yarn is used to produce a new fabric, which is then cut and sewn into modern, comfortable T-shirts.
In this way, we give waste a second life and show that sustainable fashion can be both stylish and responsible.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Prices</h3>
      <p>T-Morrow is a sustainable fashion startup dedicated to turning waste into wear. By using recycled materials like plastic bottles (rPET) and discarded textiles, we produce high-quality, stylish t-shirts that make a statement—for both fashion and the planet. Our name reflects our mission: building a better tomorrow, starting with what you wear today.

      Each T-Morrow shirt costs between €6.50 and €9.50 to produce. This includes the cost of eco-friendly materials, ethical manufacturing, packaging, and shipping. We sell our shirts for €25, leaving a healthy gross margin of around €15 to €18.50 per piece.

      Assuming monthly sales of 1,000 shirts, we expect to generate €25,000 in revenue. After subtracting production costs (roughly €8,000), our gross profit lands between €15,000 and €18,500.

      We currently operate with a lean team of two full-time employees, each earning a net salary of €2,500—which amounts to around €4,200 gross in Germany. Total monthly personnel costs come to €8,400.

      Additional fixed expenses include:

     €800 for rent (workspace and small storage),

      €1,000 for digital marketing and social media ads,

      €100 for website and online tools, and

      €500 for insurance, electricity, and miscellaneous costs.

      All together, our fixed monthly costs add up to around €10,800.

      With total monthly costs (fixed + variable) of approximately €18,800, T-Morrow stands to earn a net monthly profit of around €6,200 before taxes.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why we help others by selling T-Shirts</h3>
      
      <p>When we take action to support others, we’re showing solidarity and sending a powerful message: we see the suffering of others, and we care enough to help. This message can offer hope and dignity to people who might feel forgotten by the world. Our actions don’t just provide immediate assistance—they can also inspire others to get involved. When people see what we’re doing, they may feel motivated to donate, join a good cause, or reflect on their own privileges and how they can contribute.

         Beyond raising awareness, the money we donate plays a vital role in supporting long-term change. It helps organizations create lasting solutions, such as education programs, safe shelters, and access to health services and clean water. This kind of support can make a real difference in the lives of individuals and communities over time.

         By combining creativity with compassion, we can do even more. Instead of simply asking for donations, offering something meaningful in return—like a custom-designed T-shirt—adds value and impact. This approach blends design and creativity with planning, organization, and a strong sense of purpose. The money raised through such efforts goes toward helping others while also giving people something tangible and symbolic.

         Choosing fair-trade or eco-friendly shirts enhances the impact even further, promoting ethical and sustainable choices. The funds raised support lasting, positive change through trusted organizations. T-shirts are an especially effective tool because they are widely worn and highly visible, making them practical, personal, and symbolic. They’re easy to produce and sell, but they carry a powerful message that can reach far and wide.

         Ultimately, the financial support we generate goes directly to charities and NGOs that provide essential services—feeding hungry children, building schools in underprivileged areas, offering medical care, and supporting refugees or disaster victims. Every step we take, whether big or small, contributes to a broader movement of empathy, action, and lasting change..</p>
